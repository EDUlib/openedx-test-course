Open edX Test Course (and Test Libraries)
#########################################

Rationale
*********

In order to make testing Open edX easier,
this course aims to expose as many Open edX Studio & courseware features as possible
by providing example usages of all the preinstalled block types
and by enabling various features through Advanced Settings. 
It serves as a supplement to the simpler & more curated 
`Open edX Demo Course <https://github.com/openedx/openedx-demo-course>`_,
which is useful for basic testing, but also needs to remain a suitable first experience for Open edX learners,

Status
******

This is a work-in-progress.
